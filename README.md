Space illustrations!!

I have always been fascinated by space, there's something special about its simplicity yet at the same time its complexity. It could take years to draw even 1% of what we have discovered so far, which is why for my project I will focus on our own little space in the universe: The Solar System. My plan is to have three different pieces/drawings showcasing our very own solar system, each will display a different representation that in a way illustrates our understanding of space throughout time. The fist drawing will be flat drawing, relying on circles and using svgs and css. The second will be a more three-dimensional looking solar system, there will be spheres, however, it will be somewhat static. The third will be a much more immersive experience, using the skybox to show the solar system in full action. The first drawing is supposed to represent our initial understanding, our assumption of how all planets were flat. The second is supposed to represent our better understanding of space, but still the lack of ability to explore it. And the third will represent our explorative nature in space.
